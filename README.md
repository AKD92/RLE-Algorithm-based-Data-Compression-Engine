# RLE Algorithm based Data Compression Engine
This project aims to the successful development of Run Length Encoding (RLE) data compression software. It will be designed as a library software in order to be able to incorporate RLE based data compression/decompression facility into external software projects. This project will provide simple and easy API for the programmers. Code will be written accounting efficiency to achieve maximum execution performance as well as blazingly fast compression/decompression of arbitrary data.
